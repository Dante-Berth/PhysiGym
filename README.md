# Abstract:

PhysiCell is a physics-based cell simulator for 3D multicellular systems.
More precisely, [PhysiCell](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell) is an agent-based model and diffusion transport solver that is off-lattice, center-based, multiscale in space and time, and written in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).

[Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/main/) is the API standard for reinforcement learning, written in [Python3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language).

The Python3-based physigym module presented here was written on top of the py3pc_embed [embedding](https://github.com/elmbeech/physicellembedding) module, which makes it possible to interact with PhysiCell models in the Python3 language.

Both, physigym and embedding, are PhysiCell custom_modules.

Walking through the [tutorial](https://github.com/Dante-Berth/PhysiGym/blob/main/man/TUTORIAL_physigym.md), you will gain the understanding needed to tackle more complex PhysiCell-based reinforcement learning projects.
You will set up a very basic template model that can figure as a starting;point for your own project.

May the force be with you!

# About Documentation:

Within the PhysiGym library, we tried to stick to the documentation policy laid out by Daniele Procida in his "[what nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azf6yzuJt54)" talk at PyCon 2017 in Portland, Oregon.
