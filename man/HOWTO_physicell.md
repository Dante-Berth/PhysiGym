## How to install PhysiCell

To install PhysiCell, please follow the instruction from the latest PhysiCell workshop for your operating system.
The "Modeler Setup" is good enough (there is no need for the "Hackathon Setup").

## Newer solution from Elmar
You have to install a modified version of PhysiCell called [physigym](https://github.com/elmbeech/PhysiCell/tree/physigym)
```
git clone https://github.com/elmbeech/PhysiCell.git
git switch physigym
```
