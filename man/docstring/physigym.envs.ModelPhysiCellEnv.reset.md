## input:

            seed: integer or None; default is None
                seed = None: generate random seeds for python and PhyiCell (via the setting.xml file).
                seed < 0: take seed from setting.xml
                seed >= 0: seed python and PhysiCell (via the setting.xml file) with this value.

            options: dictionary or None
                reserved for possible future use.

## output:
```
            o_observation: structure
                the exact structure has to be
                specified in the get_observation_space function.

            d_info: dictionary
                what information to be captured has to be
                specified in the get_info function.

## description:
```
            The reset method will be called to initiate a new episode,
            increment episode counter, reset episode step counter.
            You may assume that the step method will not be called
            before the reset function has been called.
